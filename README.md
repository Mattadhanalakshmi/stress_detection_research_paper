## Abstract
Stress is a significant psychological factor that affects both mental and physical health. Timely detection and management of stress are essential to prevent adverse effects on well-being.  

In this study, Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) was employed using the Extended Cohn-Kanade (CK+) dataset, focusing on emotions such as anger, fear, sadness, and contempt for stress classification. Two pre-trained architectures (VGG16 and ResNet-50) were evaluated alongside a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed for efficiency.  

**Results:**  
- ResNet-50: 97.4% accuracy  
- VGG16: 98.2% accuracy  
- Proposed Custom CNN: 99.5% accuracy with fewer parameters and faster training  

The proposed model proved lightweight, non-invasive, and highly effective for real-time stress detection in practical environments.
